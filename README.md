## Project Structure

The project structure is organized for clarity and maintainability. Below is a brief overview of the main files and directories:

- **src/**
  - **components/**
    - `Cards.svelte`: Component for displaying individual news cards.
    - `HeroSection.svelte`: Component for the hero section of the web app.
    - `NewSection.svelte`: Component for the new section of the web app.
    - `nav.svelte`: Component for the navigation bar.
  - `App.svelte`: Main application file.
- **public/**
  - **images/**
    - Contains images used in the application.

## Components

### Cards Component (`Cards.svelte`)

The `Cards` component is used to display individual news cards. It takes parameters such as image source (`src`), card number (`num`), heading (`h_one`), and paragraph (`paragraph`).

### HeroSection Component (`HeroSection.svelte`)

The `HeroSection` component represents the hero section of the web app.

### NewSection Component (`NewSection.svelte`)

The `NewSection` component represents the new section of the web app.

### Nav Component (`nav.svelte`)

The `Nav` component is responsible for the navigation bar.

## Styling

The styling of the web app is done using inline styles within the `style` tag in the `App.svelte` file. The styling includes responsive design adjustments using media queries for both small screens and larger screens (min-width: 1024px).

- **Responsive Design:**
  - On small screens, the content is displayed in a single column.
  - On larger screens (min-width: 1024px), the content is displayed in a grid layout with specified column and row configurations.
